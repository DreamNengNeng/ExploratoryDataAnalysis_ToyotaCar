# ExploratoryDataAnalysis_ToyotaCar

The EDA contains four parts:

- Part 1) Data Explore (summary statistics, any issues with the data or key insights, and visual inspection of important data columns)

- Part 2) Data Cleaning (duplicate, missing, poorly formed, standardization of categorical data, etc.)

- Part 3) Pose an interesting question that can be answered by the cleaned dataset

- Part 4) Suggest some improvements that could be made in order to better collect this data
